# ‚öôÔ∏è My Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! These dotfiles manage my development environment across various machines, ensuring a consistent and efficient workflow.

## ‚ú® What are Dotfiles?

Dotfiles are configuration files for applications and tools that start with a `.` (dot) and are usually hidden in your home directory. They control everything from your shell prompt and editor settings to your terminal multiplexer and version control configurations.

I use [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) to manage these dotfiles, which allows me to securely and idempotently deploy my configurations across different systems.

## üöÄ Installation & Usage with Chezmoi

To use these dotfiles, you'll need to have [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/install/) installed on your system.

1.  **Install Chezmoi:**

    ```bash
    # On macOS
    brew install chezmoi

    # On Linux (example for Debian/Ubuntu)
    sudo apt install chezmoi
    # Or download from https://www.chezmoi.io/install/
    ```

2.  **Clone and Apply Dotfiles:**

    ```bash
    chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/gauravbadarkhe/dotfiles.git
